2.8 BASIC OPERATORS, MATHS

terms: unary, binary, operand

opreand: 5*2  // here operand are 5 and 2  called “ARGUMENTS” as well

unary operator: if is a simple operand . Example - in an argument changes sign of a number

binary operator : if it has 2 arguments: EXAMPLE - in a subtraction: 3-2

	Operators:

	MATH:  	+	adition
			-	substraction
			*	multiplication
			/	division
			%	remainder
					the rest of a division:

					6%4 = 2 //the rest of that division
	
			**	exponenciation


				2**4 = 16

STRING CONCATENATION WITH +

	“my”+”streng” = mystreng

	´1´+2 = ´12´

	2+ ´1´ = ´21´

	
	´1´-2 = -1

	´6´/ ´3´ = 2


	both operators convert its arguments in numbers


	NUMERIC CONVERSION WITH +

		any other kind of value turns into a number with unary operator +


		(+true);  //  1

		(+””);	//0

		is like Number() function


	OPERATOR PRECEDENCE
