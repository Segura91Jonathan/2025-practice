2.2 code structure

	-statements : with or without semicolons
		alert(“message1”);alert(“message2”);

		alert(“message1”);
		alert(“message2”);
		
		alert(“message1”)
		alert(“message2”)

		recommendation to put semicolons

	-comments :  //	1 line comment
			//       multiline comment

		nested comments are not supported:


		/* 
			//	
		*/

2.3 the modern mode “use strict”

	needs to be at the top of script  in order to work with that script in a modern way

	once you put “use strict” you cannot going back in your script

	we must “use strict”  in all our codes until we use clases and that structures

2.4 variables

	//structure : 


	//older scripts var variableName

	let variableName;

	variableName = value;

	alert(variable name)



	let var1 = value1
	let var2 = value2



	let var1 = value1,
	     var2 = value2,
	     var3 = value3;


	copying data:


	let hello = “hello world”;

	let message = hello

	alert(hello)
	alert(message)


	you can declare a variable once . More than that makes an error

	.1st character cannot be a number
	.name must contain only letters, digits or symbols _ or $

		reserved names:

		let, class, return, function

	assignment without LET is posible if you don´t put “use strict”

		num = 5


	constant

		instead let we can use const


		const pi = 3.14


	values for variableName

		string, int


	NOMENCATURE

		some constant are written this way : COLOR_LALA


		use an extra variable instead reusing
